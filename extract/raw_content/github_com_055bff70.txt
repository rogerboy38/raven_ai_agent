Ah that s why. You need to be on Frappe v15.63.0 or higher to use the mobile app - we fixed a few issues related to web
\*sockets\* using OAuth bearer tokens in the framework to support the mobile app.

When the user hits send, add the message to the stream without waiting for the real-time web \*socket\* event.
This can be further enhanced later by optimistically updating the stream (before the message is sent and response is
received)

Possible options:
1. Either create a new room for Raven itself - not sure if that s possible in the custom \*socket\* handler in Frappe
2. Publish events to the Raven Settings doctype - and subscribe to that on the frontend.
