Production setup
----------------


### Managed Hosting

You can try [Frappe Cloud](https://frappecloud.com), a simple, user-friendly and sophisticated [open-source](https://github.com/frappe/press) platform to host Frappe applications with peace of mind.

It takes care of installation, setup, upgrades, monitoring, maintenance and support of your Frappe deployments. It is a fully featured developer platform with an ability to manage and control multiple Frappe deployments.

[![]()](https://frappecloud.com/dashboard/signup?product=raven)

### Self Hosting

Follow these steps to set up Raven in production:

**Step 1**: Download the easy install script

```
wget https://frappe.io/easy-install.py
```

**Step 2**: Run the deployment command

```
python3 ./easy-install.py deploy \
    --project=raven_prod_setup \
    --email=your_email.example.com \
    --image=ghcr.io/the-commit-company/raven \
    --version=stable \
    --app=raven \
    --sitename subdomain.domain.tld
```

Replace the following parameters with your values:

* `your_email.example.com`: Your email address
* `subdomain.domain.tld`: Your domain name where Raven will be hosted

The script will set up a production-ready instance of Raven with all the necessary configurations in about 5 minutes.

Development Setup
-----------------


### Docker

You need Docker, docker-compose and git setup on your machine. Refer [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/). After that, follow below steps:

**Step 1**: Setup folder and download the required files

```
mkdir raven
cd raven

# Download the docker-compose file
wget -O docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/The-Commit-Company/raven/develop/docker/docker-compose.yml

# Download the setup script
wget -O init.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/The-Commit-Company/raven/develop/docker/init.sh

```

**Step 2**: Run the container and daemonize it

```
docker compose up -d

```

**Step 3**: The site <http://raven.localhost:8000/raven> should now be available. The default credentials are:

* Username: Administrator
* Password: admin

### Local

To setup the repository locally follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Install bench and setup a `frappe-bench` directory by following the [Installation Steps](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/installation)
2. Start the server by running

```
bench start
```

1. In a separate terminal window, create a new site by running

```
bench new-site raven.test
```

1. Map your site to localhost with the command

```
bench --site raven.test add-to-hosts
```

1. Download the Raven app. Run

```
bench get-app https://github.com/The-Commit-Company/raven
```

1. Install the app on the site

```
bench --site raven.test install-app raven
```

1. Now open the URL `http://raven.test:8000/raven` in your browser, you should see the app running

###### Other Local Configurations

Make sure that you have enabled [developer mode](https://frappeframework.com/how-to-enable-developer-mode-in-frappe) in your Frappe site config. You can do so by running the following in your bench directory:

```
bench set-config -g developer_mode 1
```

You also need to disable CSRF (add `ignore_csrf: 1` in your `site_config.json`) since the React web server will not have any CSRF token in live reload mode. Please note that this is only for the local dev setup and is **not meant for Production**.

```
bench --site raven.test set-config ignore_csrf 1
```

##### Web App

Raven's **web app** is a React based single page app located in the `/frontend` directory. It uses Vite to compile the app.
If you want to make changes to the frontend with hot reloading, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the apps/raven folder in your bench directory

```
cd apps/raven
```

1. Start the local web server

```
yarn run dev
```

This will start a local server at `http://localhost:8080` where the frontend app can be previewed in real time as you make changes. To make sure the setup works correctly, add a `.env.local` file in the `/frontend` directory with the following contents:

```
VITE_BASE_NAME='' # This needs to be set as empty
VITE_SOCKET_PORT=9000 # This is the port on which socket.io is running. It's usually the main Frappe server port (8000) but in the 9000 series
VITE_SITE_NAME='raven.test' # This is the same of the site

```

##### Mobile App

Raven's **mobile app** is a React Native based app built using Expo. It requires an [Expo Development Build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/) and will not run on Expo Go.

To get started, you need to install the [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/tools/#expo-cli)

```
npm install -g eas-cli
```

You also need to have Xcode and/or Android Studio installed locally depending on your platform of choice.

The mobile app is located under the `apps/mobile` directory.
To start the development server and run it on a simulator, you can run

```
yarn run ios
```

or

```
yarn run android

```

This *should* start the emulators with the app running. For more info, please refer to the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/introduction/)
